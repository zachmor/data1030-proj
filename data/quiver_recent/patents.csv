1167,2022-10-11,AAPL,18.0,h01q021/28,"an electronic device may include first and second phased antenna arrays that convey radio-frequency signals at frequencies greater than 10 ghz. the second array may have fewer antennas than the first array. control circuitry may control the first and second arrays in a diversity mode and in a simultaneous array mode. in the diversity mode, the first array may form a first signal beam while the second array is inactive. when the first array is blocked by an object or otherwise exhibits unsatisfactory performance, the second array may form a second signal beam while the first array is inactive. in the simultaneous mode, the first and second arrays may form a combined array that produces a third signal beam. the combined array may maximize gain. hierarchical beam searching operations may be performed. the arrays may be distributed across one or more modules."
1168,2022-10-11,AAPL,23.0,h04b017/318,"methods, systems, and storage media are described for radio link monitoring (rlm) for new radio (nr). other embodiments may be described and/or claimed."
1169,2022-10-11,AAPL,32.0,g08b001/08,"in an example method, a mobile device obtains sample data generated by one or more sensors over a period of time, where the one or more sensors are worn by a user. the mobile device determines that the user has fallen based on the sample data, and determines, based on the sample data, a severity of an injury suffered by the user. the mobile device generates one or more notifications based on the determination that the user has fallen and the determined severity of the injury."
1170,2022-10-11,AAPL,20.0,g06f021/62,"in some implementations, a computing device can restrict the use of another computing device in certain contexts. for example, a parent may wish to use the parent's computing device to restrict her children's use of the children's computing devices while the children are in school while the children should be participating in some other activity. for example, the parent's controller device may be enabled to remotely configure and control the usage of the satellite device(s) without needing to physically access the satellite device. the parent may implement limitations, permissions, or different policies that may govern, for example, the ability of the satellite device to communicate with other devices, execute various application functionalities, run any particular software, and manage its own settings."
1171,2022-10-11,AAPL,19.0,g09g003/20,an electronic device may have a variable refresh rate display. static content may be displayed on the display at a lower refresh rate than moving content to conserve power. the display may include an array of pixels. display driver circuitry in the display may load image data into rows of the pixels. the display driver circuitry may have digital-to-analog converter circuitry that supplies data signals to the array. the display driver circuitry may respond to a variable refresh rate control signal that is asserted and deasserted depending on whether static or moving image content is to be displayed. the display driver circuitry may use the digital-to-analog converter circuitry to apply a time-varying scaling factor to the image data. the magnitude of the scaling factor may be adjusted during transitions between refresh rates to help suppress luminance variations that might otherwise result in flickering on the display.
1172,2022-10-11,AAPL,39.0,g08b021/00,"an electronic device, while displaying representations of a plurality of collections of media items, detects a swipe input that starts at a location corresponding to a first representation of a first collection of media items in the plurality of collections of media items. in response to detecting the swipe input: in accordance with a determination that the swipe input is in a first direction, the device scrolls the representations of the plurality of collections of media items in the first direction; and, in accordance with a determination that the swipe input is in a different, second direction, the device: ceases to display a representation of a first item in the first collection of media items, and displays a representation of a second item in the first collection of media items, without scrolling; and generates a tactile output corresponding to displaying the representation of the second item."
1173,2022-10-11,AAPL,20.0,g06f021/56,"systems, apparatuses, and methods for efficient handling of subroutine epilogues. when an indirect control transfer instruction corresponding to a procedure return for a subroutine is identified, the return address and a signature are retrieved from one or more of a return address stack and the memory stack. an authenticator generates a signature based on at least a portion of the retrieved return address. while the signature is being generated, instruction processing speculatively continues. no instructions are permitted to commit yet. the generated signature is later compared to a copy of the signature generated earlier during the corresponding procedure call. a mismatch causes an exception."
